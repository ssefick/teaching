1) USING GGPLOT2


Background

In this exercise, you will explore a dataset that is included with R by
making a variety of graphs using the ggplot2 package inside of R studio.
Specificaly, we will investigate how a number of variables affect miles
per gallon (mpg).

Explaination of the mtcars data: The data was extracted from the 1974
MOTOR TREND US magazine,and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of
automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models)
(From: ?mtcars).


Exercise

EXPLORE THE USE OF THE GGPLOT2 PACKAGE.

1.  Install ggplot2 and grid.

          install.packages(c("ggplot2", "grid"))  

    -   The online documentation for ggplot2 is:

2.  Load the ggplot2 package and the mtcars data.

          library(ggplot2)
          data(mtcars)

3.  Look at the transmission type column (am). Now, change transmission
    type to a more intuitive coding.

          mtcars[mtcars$am==1,"am"] <- "automatic" 
          mtcars[mtcars$am==0,"am"] <- "manual"

4.  In order to access how the data might be distributed, make a
    histogram of mpg, and color it by transmission type.

          qplot(mpg, data=mtcars, geom="histogram", bins=5, fill=am, col=am)

5.  Make 2 boxplots to explore the effect of number of gears and
    cylendars on mpg. Use the GEOM argument. Use the theming system to
    change the default look of ggplot2. Because the number of cylendars
    and gears are numeric (e.g., str(mtcars$cyl)), make cyl and gear
    into a factor (i.e., qplot(as.factor(cyl), mpg,
    data=mtcars, geom="boxplot")).

          #Theming system example. See the documentation for more information
          qplot(as.factor(c(rep("A",5), rep("B", 5))), 1:10, geom="boxplot")+theme_bw()

    -   NOTICE THE X AXIS LABEL IS NON-SENSE. It is probably a good idea
        to fix this. Use xlab in the qplot command to fix this (look at
        the documentation of if you are having problems).

6.  We might be interested in whether automatic and manual transmission
    have the same relationships. You want to use the facet_wrap()
    functionality.

          #Theming system example. See the documentation for more information
          your_plot+facet_wrap(~am)

7.  Make a scatterplot to explore the relationship of horsepower and
    miles per gallon.

8.  Use a smoother to explore this relationship. Specifically, use a
    lowess smoothing line.

          #Theming system example. See the documentation for more information
          your_plot+geom_smooth()

9.  Do these data suggest a linear or some other type of relationship?
    -   Try log transforming both mpg and hp

              #log transform
              qplot(log(hp), log(mpg), data=mtcars)+geom_smooth()

    -   Is this relationship LINEAR NOW?

10. We can use specific methods in geom_smooth(). Now that we are
    convinced of log linear relationship. We can use a linear model to
    explore these data.

          #log transform
          qplot(log(hp), log(mpg), data=mtcars)+geom_smooth(method="lm")

11. Explore this relationship with transmission type included as
    a facet.

12. Does the intercept look the same?

13. Does the slope look the same?

14. The faceted graph is nice looking but it would be better to look at
    these relationships without the facet. This can be acomplished with
    setting color or shape. Color these graphs by transmission type.

          #log transform
          qplot(log(hp), log(mpg), data=mtcars, col=am)+geom_smooth()

15. Everything else being EQUAL, and assuming you want to optimize MPG.
    What type of transmission would you choose?

16. Since this data is multivariate, use geom_grid() the relationship of
    hp with mpg but also adding the information of gear, transmission,
    and number of cylendars. With what we have learned previously and
    gridded faceting (i.e., facet_grid())

      mpg_hp_gear_trans_cyl <- qplot(hp, mpg, data=mtcars, geom="blank")+facet_grid(gear~am)

      mpg_hp_gear_trans_cyl+geom_smooth(method="lm")+geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)))



2) TIME SERIES - EXPERIMENT SANDY CREEK


Background

The data come from an experiment that I ran in 2013 in a creek near
Waverly, AL. I used velocity (random slope) nested within block (random
intercept) in a mixed model framework. I did this to statistically
account for differences in velocity within block. This dataset has 3
columns.


Column Description

-   DATE is date of velocity measurement
-   BLOCK is experimental block
-   VELOCITY is mean velocity within a block

Questions

1.  Does velocity vary with time?

2.  Does velocity vary among blocks?

3.  There was a rain event during the experiment. When was this?


Exercise

MAKE A PLOT TO INVESTIGATE HOW VELOCITY CHANGES THROUGH TIME AND BLOCK.

1.  Create a file named YOUR_NAME_TIME_SERIES.R in the
    TIME_SERIES folder. Read in EXPERIMENT_VELOCITY_TIME_SERIES.CSV to
    an object called vel_exp

          #must change date into class Date in order to have qplot recognize as such.
          vel_exp <- read.csv("experiment_velocity_time_series.csv")

2.  load the ggplot2 library, and change Date to Date class. This will
    ensure that ggplot2 can recognize this as a Date.

          #must change date into class Date in order to have qplot recognize as such.
          library(ggplot2)
          vel_exp$date <- as.Date(vel_exp$date)

3.  Plot the relationship of Date with velocity as a line graph using
    qplot (e.g., qplot(x, y, ...))

4.  Use the col argument to color the lines by block

5.  Decide if you want a facet or not
    (i.e., facet_wrap(~variable_of_interest)

6.  Explore the “theme-ing” system theme_bw() or the custom theme that I
    have provided you.

7.  To have the custom theme usable you will have to source the file
    publication_ggplot2_theme.R with the source command.

          #use my publication theme
          source("publication_ggplot2_theme.R")
          your_plot+publication()

8.  Once you have arrived at a suitable graph save it as a pdf called
    name_ggplot2_time_series.pdf as you did before.

          pdf("name")
          your_ggplot2_plot_object
          dev.off

9.  Please answer the questions posed above in a text file named
    name_velocity_answers.txt
