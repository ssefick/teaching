Ex 1.
Step 10. These data does not suggest a linear relationship. However, after log transformation, the relationship become linear
Step 13.  The intercept is different among two different types of transmission.
Step 14. The slope will be very close. 
Step 15. Automatic performs better in mpg.
Ex 2.
1. The velocity does vary with time. It mainly increased over time. However, the pattern is not uniform among all the blocks. 
2. The velocity does very among all the blocks. The velocity increased over time in block A,B,D,E,F. However, in block B, the velocity remains same over time. In addition, block B has the lowest mean velocity. 
3. The rain event should be on Nov 25, because there is a uniform increase in velocity at all blocks on Nov 25.
